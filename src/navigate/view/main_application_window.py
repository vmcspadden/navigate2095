class MainApp(ttk.Frame):
    """Creates the frame that will hold the GUI content, its parent is the main window
    or root Tk object

    A main window is created and passed to the mainapp class. This class will init as a
    frame then config the main window. It then creates a menubar using the menubar
    class.

    Adds the options for each file menu. It then sets up the frames, then grids the
    frames.

    Finally, it uses the notebook classes to put them into the respective frames on the
    tk.Grid. Each of the notebook classes includes tab classes and inits those etc.

    The second parameter in each class __init__ function is the parent.

    I used the name of the parent so that it would be easier to keep track of
    inheritances.

    Once you have the parent name you can look to the parents class in the class
    definition.

    For example for class Main_App(ttk.Frame) the parent to Main_App is a frame and its
    name is root. I also used the name of the class instead of self to make things
    easier to read. So for Main_App self is now mainapp.

    Placing the notebooks using tk.Grid. While the grid is called on each frame it
    is actually calling the main window since those are the parent to the frames.
    The labels have already been packed into each respective frame so can be ignored
    in the grid setup. This layout uses a 2x2 grid to start.

    1   2
    3   4
    5   6

    The above is the grid "spots" the left frame will take spots 3 & 5 while top
    right takes spot 4 and bottom right frame takes spot 6. Top frame will be
    spots 1 & 2
